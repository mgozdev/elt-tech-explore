Requires Databricks workspace and authentication.

## Sample Implementation

Coming soon: Examples for loading N-PORT data into Delta Lake on Databricks.

## Performance Considerations

- Photon engine for optimized query execution
- Auto-loader for incremental ingestion
- Z-ordering and data skipping
- Caching strategies

## Use Cases

- Enterprise lakehouse implementations
- When governance and collaboration are priorities
